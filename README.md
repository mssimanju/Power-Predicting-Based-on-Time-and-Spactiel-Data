An project created to predict the solar power of an area based on weather data with some algorithims. 

1.Crawl the data with the data crawling program.

2.Run BPTIME, BPSPACE, LSTM to compelete the first round prediction.

3. Run Regression to integrate three algorithms and test. Final result will also be generated as an .html file.
